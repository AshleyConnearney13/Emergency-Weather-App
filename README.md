# THE FOLLOWING IS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL PURPOSES ONLY!
# Setting up how to push to GitHub repo branch(es)
1. When you have the repo files installed (example: C:/......./whelter-app), open up Command Prompt and change the directory to this location.
2. Run "git push --set-upstream origin XXXXX"
      a. Note: XXXXX stands for the branch name. You are setting the "origin" directory (the folder, whelter-app) to connect to a branch, XXXXX, that either exists or is 
         to be created.
3. Run "git add ." to queue files in the folder, whelter-app, for a commit.
4. Run "git commit -m "XXXXX"" to commit the files to your LOCAL repository.
      a. Note: XXXXX stands for the title of the commit to show. This displays to the right of the file name on GitHub, so write something that describes what changed in 
         the file(s) that makes them relate to eachother.
5. Run "git push origin "XXXXX" to push the files to the ONLINE repository on GitHub, where everyone will be able to see the changes.
      a. Note: XXXXX stands for the branch name being pushed to. This should be the same as the branch name defined in Step 2.
